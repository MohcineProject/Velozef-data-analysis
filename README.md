# Architecture Kappa with Docker & docker-compose

# General

A simple spark standalone cluster for your testing environment purposses. A *docker-compose up* away from you solution for your spark development environment.

The Docker compose will create the following containers:

container|Exposed ports
---|---
spark-master|9090 7077
spark-worker-1|9091
spark-worker-2|9092
demo-database|5432

# Installation

The following steps will make you run your spark cluster's containers.

## Pre requisites

* Docker installed

* Docker compose  installed

## Build the image


```sh
docker build -t cluster-apache-spark:3.0.2 .
```

## Run the docker-compose

The final step to create your test cluster will be to run the compose file:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Validate your cluster

Just validate your cluster accesing the spark UI on each worker & master URL.

### Spark Master

http://localhost:9090/

### Spark Worker 1

http://localhost:9091/

### Spark Worker 2

http://localhost:9092/

# Resource Allocation 

This cluster is shipped with three workers and one spark master, each of these has a particular set of resource allocation(basically RAM & cpu cores allocation).

* The default CPU cores allocation for each spark worker is 1 core.

* The default RAM for each spark-worker is 1024 MB.

* The default RAM allocation for spark executors is 256mb.

* The default RAM allocation for spark driver is 128mb

* If you wish to modify this allocations just edit the env/spark-worker.sh file.

# Binded Volumes

To make app running easier I've shipped two volume mounts described in the following chart:

Host Mount|Container Mount|Purposse
---|---|---
apps|/opt/spark-apps|Used to make available your app's jars on all workers & master
data|/opt/spark-data| Used to make available your app's data on all workers & master

This is basically a dummy DFS created from docker Volumes...(maybe not...)

# Run Sample applications

<!-- ```sh
docker exec -it tp3_docker-spark-worker-a bash
```

To submit the app connect to one of the workers or the master and execute:

```sh
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
--driver-memory 1G \
--executor-memory 1G \
/opt/spark-apps/TP3_exercice1_DataFrame.py
```

```sh
/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
/opt/spark-apps/TP3_exercice1_DataFrame.py
```

```sh
python3 /opt/spark-apps/TP3_exercice1_DataFrame.py
```
